A Python class for read/write Inrimage images. The module is based on =ctypes=.

* Installation
  Currently, it is very rudimentary: you have to edit =install.sh=
  script and set up variable =INRPYTHONDIR= (the place where you want
  to install Inrpython). A Fortran compiler is required. Then, just type:

: ./install.sh 

  The script ask you to touch your =~/.bashrc= file for adding
  =INRPYTHONDIR= in =PYTHONPATH= environ variable.
