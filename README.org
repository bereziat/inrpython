A Python class for read/write Inrimage images. The module is based on =ctypes=.

* Installation
  A very rudimentary script allow to install the module in your environment. Warning: 
  this installation procedure is not in the golden standard of pytho. It just use 
  environ variable =PYTHONPATH=.

  - Dependencies: a Fortran compiler is required.
  -  Default installation (in =/usr/local/inrpython=):
  : ./install.sh
  - Installation in another directory:
  : INRPYTHONDIR=install_path  ./install.sh 

  After installation, the script then ask you to touch your =~/.bashrc= file for adding
  =INRPYTHONDIR= in =PYTHONPATH= environ variable.
