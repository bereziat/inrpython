A Python class for read/write Inrimage images. The module is based on
=ctypes= and currently works only with =python2=.


* Installation
  Actually, it is very rudimentary: you have to edit =install.sh=
  script and set up variable =INRPYTHONDIR= (the place where you want
  to install Inrpython). 

  The scripts ask you to touch your =~/.bashrc= file and add
  =INRPYTHONDIR= in =PYTHONPATH= environ variable.
