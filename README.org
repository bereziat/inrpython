A Python class for read/write Inrimage images. The module is based on =ctypes=.

* Installation
  A very rudimentary script allows you to install the module in your environment. Warning: 
  this installation procedure is not in the golden standard of Python. It just relies on the
  environ variable =PYTHONPATH=.

  - Dependencies: a Fortran compiler
  - Default installation (in =/usr/local/inrpython=), type in a terminal:
  : ./install.sh
  - Installation in another directory:
  : INRPYTHONDIR=install_path  ./install.sh 

  After installation, the script then ask you to touch your =~/.bashrc= file for
  setting up the =PYTHONPATH= environ variable.
